# 👋 Hi, I’m Sankarsh Nellutla

I transform complex datasets into strategic insights that drive product and business decisions. With over two years of experience in data engineering, analytics, and data science, I build scalable ETL architectures, develop machine learning models, and present findings through clear, actionable dashboards.

## 📈 Data Journey { .incremental }

**Discovery (2021–2022)**  
I began by automating data preprocessing and feature engineering for sentiment analysis and health prediction projects, gaining a foundation in data cleaning and model evaluation.

**Development (2022–2023)**  
At Shiash Info Solutions, I designed and launched ETL frameworks that reduced data preparation time by 50% and created interactive dashboards to communicate key insights to stakeholders.

**Scaling (2024)**  
With NG Talent Tech, I architected AWS-based pipelines processing over 2 million records daily, implemented CI/CD workflows, and maintained 99.9% data pipeline uptime.

**Innovation (Present)**  
I’m exploring causal inference techniques, MLOps best practices, and advanced BI architectures to enhance data reliability and foster informed decision-making.
